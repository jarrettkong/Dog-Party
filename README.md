# Dog Party
This goal of this project is to recreate a composition of a dog website.

## Description
The final webpage was written with HTML and CSS for desktop and the following mobile devices: iPad/iPad Pro, iPhone 6/7/8/X/Xs as well as the Plus models for each, and iPhone 5/SE. There is an additional JavaScript file to change the text for *Some Dogs* based on user input, and to make the mobile dropdown menus function correctly.

Below is the original comp to replicate:

## Getting Started

Open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser of choice.

## Known Issues

While the website is currently formatted for many mobile devices, it does not respond to resizing or zooming of the brower window itself.
